          question:
            'You work in an office, performing a job that you find satisfying (and which compensates you adequately).  The company that employs you is suddenly purchased by an eccentric millionaire who plans to immediately raise each persons salary by 5 percent and extend an extra week of vacation to full time employees.  However, this new owner intends to enforce a somewhat radical dress code: Every day, men will have to wear tuxedos, tails, and top hats (during the summer months, male employees will be allowed to wear gray three-piece suits on "casual" Fridays). Women must exclusively work in formal wear, preferably ball gowns or prom dresses.  Each employee will be given an annual $1,500 stipend to purchase necessary garments, but that money an only be spend on work-related clothing.  The new regime starts in three months.

I saw a man in a black cape bite a womans neck and drink her blood. I know this sounds crazy, but I am that certain what I saw is real." Your prospective spouse is in a state of panic and pleads with you to believe his/her story. You can tell that this is really, important to them.

These are his only tricks and he can not learn any more; he can only do these five. However, it turns out that he is doing these five tricks with real magic.

If you were watching The Office on NBC and decided that Jim should marry Pam (or Karen, or both), you could make it happen all you would need to do is think about that specific desire. You could stare at an oil painting and unconsciously change the color contrasts. You could (essentially) write books as you read them, eliminating certain characters and redirecting plot points as they occurred in the text.
